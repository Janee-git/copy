AMQ5534E: User ID 'mqm' authentication failed

EXPLANATION:
The user ID and password supplied by the 'MQ Explorer 8.0.0' program could not
be authenticated.
Additional information: 'Pipe returned 2035 [FAILED]'.
ACTION:
Ensure that the correct user ID and password are provided by the application.
Ensure that the authentication repository is correctly configured. Look at
previous error messages for any additional information. If  MQ was installed
using the unzip mechanism, you must not set the authentication method option
for your configured CONNAUTH object to "OS"

AMQ5542I: The failed authentication check was caused by the queue manager
CONNAUTH CHCKCLNT(REQDADM) configuration.

EXPLANATION:
The user ID 'mqm' and its password were checked because the queue manager
connection authority (CONNAUTH) configuration refers to an authentication
information (AUTHINFO) object named 'SYSTEM.DEFAULT.AUTHINFO.IDPWOS' with
CHCKCLNT(REQDADM).

This message accompanies a previous error to clarify the reason for the user ID
and password check.
ACTION:
Refer to the previous error for more information.

Ensure that a password is specified by the client application and that the
password is correct for the user ID. The authentication configuration of the
queue manager connection determines the user ID repository. For example, the
local operating system user database or an LDAP server.

Note that if the authentication configuration specifies an LDAP user
repository, a CHCKCLNT value of REQADM is treated as equivalent to a value of
OPTIONAL.

If the CHCKCLNT setting is OPTIONAL, the authentication check can be avoided by
not passing a user ID across the channel. For example, by omitting the MQCSP
structure from the client MQCONNX API call.

To avoid the authentication check, you can amend the authentication
configuration of the queue manager connection, but you should generally not
allow unauthenticated remote access.
